 * Route-change transition: the outgoing page blurs and drops away, the
 * incoming one resolves from a slight scale and blur.
 *
 * `mode="wait"` would leave the viewport blank between routes, so the two
 * overlap instead — the incoming page is what the eye follows. Duration sits
 * at 560ms in and 380ms out: inside the 500–800ms band asked for, but the exit
 * is deliberately quicker so navigation still feels responsive.
 *
 * Keyed on pathname only, not search params — a filter change should not
 * replay the whole transition.
